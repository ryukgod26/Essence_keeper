### Large / optional game asset folders
# These folders often contain binary art/audio/models and can exceed GitHub's file size
# limits. Ignore them here if you don't want to publish the raw assets.

# If you keep some smaller assets checked in, add negation rules for specific files or
# subfolders you want to track, e.g.:
# !assets/essential_sprites/

# Recommendation: use Git LFS to store large binary assets without losing history.
# See .gitattributes for an example of file types to track with LFS.
